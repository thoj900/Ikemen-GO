OC_ex_gethitvar_nohitstate

-----------

hitDef_nohitstate
hitDef_throwmultiple

	example:
	nohitstate                 bool
	throwmultiple              int32
	
	NOTE: ARMOR only on if c.ghv.attr == 65
	if c.ghv.damage != 0 {
			if c.ss.moveType == MT_H || (c.ghv.attr == 65 && c.sf(CSF_armor) && c.ss.moveType == MT_A) || 				c.sf(CSF_nohurtstate) || c.ghv.nohitstate {
----------------

CSF_armor
CSF_nohurtstate

	example:
	func (c *Char) hitAdd(h int32) {
	c.hitCount += h
	c.uniqHitCount += h
	if !c.sf(CSF_armor) && !c.sf(CSF_nohurtstate) && !c.ghv.nohitstate && len(c.targets) > 0 {
-------------------

Summary:
armor = clash armor
nohurtstate = armor for everything just not clash
nohitstate = paremeter on hitdef so that hitdef does not change enemy into a hitstate
throwmultiple = paremeter on hitdef that allows multiple targets to be acquired during Throw type attack
